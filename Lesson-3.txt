Lesson 3
- How to use github.
- Setup remote repository using 
    # git remote
    #git remote origin git:url
-Sync local repository to remote
   #git push
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  - We should be having better idea of how our project is going. Which of the files are cpmplete.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 Fork - Tool provided by github.
      - Clone the repository on github under your user.
 Clone - Make a copy of the repository. Another user's repository or on a different system.

 Branch - When you want to work on experimental feature, which might mess up main branch.
